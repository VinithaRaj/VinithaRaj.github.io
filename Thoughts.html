		<td>Good Friends Restaurant & Café | A family-oriented eatery with Chinese-Western fusion food and coffee,Good Friends Restaurant & Café is a comfy place catering to everyone in the group: kids get crayons and paper to bring out their creative sides, while older folks can test their skills on the foosball table! Some of the popular dishes include their soups and pastas, though we highly recommend their baked eggs (RM16) for a hearty mix of cheese, eggs, vegetables and sausage. After which, you can get your dessert from PopWagon’s on-site popsicle vendor!</td>

		<td style="text-align:right">Morningwood | Who doesn’t love a punny café with a menu that can make you laugh? Morningwood attracts all sorts of fame for their humorous take on naming and their honest-to-goodness café cuisine. One of their signature drinks is the Nutella cappuccino (RM14), a coffee with heavy amounts of hazelnut chocolate for Nutella-lovin’ individuals. Get HAM sap (RM18) – not like that – for a large platter of grilled chicken and chicken ham sandwiches with a side of fries to share!</td>

		<td>Brewyard Coffee | If there’s anything you should be getting at Brewyard Coffee, it’s their set meals! Available from Tuesday to Friday, their lunch (RM13) and dinner sets (RM16) are a great deal for good food. Choose between a turkey tortilla with fries, a creamy chicken pasta, or a calamari aglio olio to go with a glass of orange juice for lunch. If you would prefer a different drink however, we suggest having the iced GEM (RM12), a layered concoction of gula Melaka, espresso, and milk!</td>
